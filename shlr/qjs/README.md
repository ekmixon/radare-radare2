QJS
===

This is a trimmed down copy of the QuickJS fork of frida, which
follows upstream and includes a couple of bug fixes.

There's no formal releases of quickjs, so distros can't package
it directly, therefor it's better to ship it.

To update the source, rimraf the `src` folder and run `make`.
